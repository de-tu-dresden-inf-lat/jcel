**jcel** is a reasoner for the [description logic](http://dl.kr.org) EL+. It uses the [OWL API](https://owlcs.github.io/owlapi/) and can be used as a plug-in for [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/).

## Source code

The project is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/julianmendez/jcel). To checkout and compile the project with [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/julianmendez/jcel.git
$ cd jcel
$ mvn clean install
```

The library, its sources and its Javadoc will be in `jcel-library/target`, the plug-in will be in `jcel-plugin/target`, the standalone will be in `jcel-standalone/target`, and the release ZIP file will be in `target`.

To compile the project offline, first download the dependencies:

```
$ mvn dependency:go-offline
```

and once offline, use:

```
$ mvn --offline clean install
```

The bundles uploaded to [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/) are created with:

```
$ mvn clean install -DperformRelease=true
```

and then on each module:

```
$ cd target
$ jar -cf bundle.jar jcel-*
```

and on the main directory:

```
$ cd target
$ jar -cf bundle.jar jcel-parent-*
```

The version number is updated with:

```
$ mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=NEW_VERSION
```

where *NEW_VERSION* is the new version.
The file [VersionInfo.java](https://github.com/julianmendez/jcel/blob/master/jcel-reasoner/src/main/java/de/tudresden/inf/lat/jcel/reasoner/main/VersionInfo.java) is updated manually.


## Architecture


### Modules

The version under development has the following modules:

* **jcel-coreontology** : set of normalized axioms
* **jcel-core** : classification algorithms using only normalized axioms
* **jcel-ontology** : set of all possible axioms and a procedure to normalize them
* **jcel-reasoner** : reasoner that can classify an ontology and can compute entailment
* **jcel-owlapi** : OWL API interface, performs the translation between the OWL API axioms and jcel axioms
* **jcel-protege** : module to connect to Protégé

It also has the following module used to build the release:

* **jcel-library** : module to create the library, its sources and its javadoc
* **jcel-plugin** : module to create the jar for Protégé
* **jcel-standalone** : module to create the standalone application
* **jcel-distribution** : module to create the release, a single ZIP file


### Algorithm

* translate OWL API axioms into jcel axioms, which are composed by integer numbers
* detect the expressivity used in the axioms
* apply normalization rules to the set of axioms, producing a set of normalized axioms and auxiliary entities if necessary
* saturate the set of normalized axioms with deduced object property axioms
* create an extended ontonlogy based on the set of normalized axioms
* apply the completion rules while there is some change in the affected sets
* remove the auxiliary entities
* build a graph containing direct subsumers (parents), direct subsumees (children) and equivalents
* create OWL API data structures based on the jcel's integer representation


### Package dependencies

If we consider each package as a node, and each dependency between two packages as a directed edge, the structure of package dependency should be a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The packages should only make public those classes that are or could be used by another package preserving the DAG structure.
